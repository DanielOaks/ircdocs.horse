<p class="note">Lots of behaviour in the IRC protocol as implemented in clients and servers today is not formally specified. If you are looking to implement IRC software, the best thing to do is look at specifications, information, and how other software behaves as a guide.</p>

<h2>Useful Specifications</h2>

<div class="link-block">
	<div class="name">
		<h3><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459">RFC1459</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812">RFC2812</a></h3>
	</div>
	<div class="details">
		<p>The earlier and the latter canonical IRC specifications, respectively.</p>

		<p>Some software holds <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459">RFC1459</a> in higher regard than <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812">RFC2812</a>, and some hold the opposite in higher regard. Honestly, the truth tends to lie somewhere in the middle.</p>

		<p>There are many parts of the newer <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812">RFC2812</a> that software authors (reasonably) consider insane. And there are many parts that have updated <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459">RFC1459</a> in useful ways and have been widely-implemented by clients and servers today.</p>

		<p>In the same way, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459">RFC1459</a> has many useful parts, and there are also many places where due to its age or simply deviating implementations, it also has information that's totally incorrect.</p>

		<p>Honestly, use these as a rough reference, say for a basic implementation. And then compare <strong>everything</strong> with multiple real-world servers and clients to find out how broken and incompatible your to-the-spec implementation is with the actual ones out there today.</p>

		<p><strong>Do not</strong> take either of these specifications as gospel. They are both very old, and have lots of places where either due to age or decision, modern software specifically does not follow them.</p>

		<p>Welcome to IRC, where the base specs we work off are all old and broken and regarded more as suggestions than anything binding. Strap in and "Thanks for flying IRC!"</p>

		<h3><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7194">RFC7194</a></h3>
	</div>
	<div class="details">
		<p>6697 is IRC's TLS port. It's now in an RFC. Hooray.</p>

		<p>This also specifies some details about certificates that are useful to keep in mind.</p>

		<h3><a href="https://github.com/grawity/irc-docs/blob/master/client/RPL_ISUPPORT/draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00.txt"><span class="mono">RPL_ISUPPORT</span> Hardy Internet-Draft</a></h3>
	</div>
	<div class="details">
		<p>Every server implements this. This is mandatory for any client implementing any sort of intelligence. Yes, this is an Internet-Draft and not an RFC. Ignore that. Even though this is not an IETF standard, <span class="mono">RPL_ISUPPORT</span> is implemented by everything.</p>

		<p>However, not all the <span class="mono">RPL_ISUPPORT</span> keys listed in this are used these days. Once again, look at various servers and networks around to see what you should implement. There is also the <a href="http://danieloaks.net/irc-defs/defs/isupport.html">RPL_ISUPPORT Token list</a> I maintain over on my <a href="http://danieloaks.net/irc-defs/">irc-defs</a> page</p>

		<h3><a href="http://ircv3.net/irc/">IRCv3 Working Group</a></h3>
	</div>
	<div class="details">
		<p>This is a working group made up of a whole bunch of IRC software authors. IRCv3 specifications are written by various software authors, submitted, and accepted if the majority of the group agrees on them. These are recommended and tend to introduce new and useful features to the IRC protocol.</p>

		<p>Regarding specific IRCv3 specifications, here are rough support matrixes for <a href="http://ircv3.net/software/clients.html">clients</a> and <a href="http://ircv3.net/software/servers.html">servers</a>.</p>
